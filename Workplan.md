# MNXB11 -Team work plan 

**Someone wants to order a pizza but can't be bothered to leave their house.**
*They look up "pizza nearby" and looks for the phone number of the first place that pops up.*
#The pizza gets ordered by phone, is rung up by the cashier, and comes through on the kitchen ticket.

So first of all, obviously, we need to have a dough ball to flatten. 
Luckily, the overnight crew have already prepared BATCHES of dough. 
Then, we need the sauce and the cheese (maybe some olives?).
Call me crazy, but the pizza needs a shower of oregano aswell. 
Also, we forbid pineapple. 


### Patrick — Cook the pizza
1. Preheat oven to 250 °C 
2. Stretch one dough ball to ~30 cm
3. Cover with tomato sauce 
4. Add  mozzarella; add assigned toppings (no pineapple).
5. Bake 6–8 min, rotate once
6. Finish with basil/olive oil. Slice into 6.
7. Box, label with order ID, put on shelf for delivery.
8. Update status: **Patrick: Pizza is cooked**

Vidar: Pizza is ready to send
We need to put it in a box, would be a shame to ruin the pizza
Our delivery driver just got back, let's give him the pizza and an adress and send him on his way
